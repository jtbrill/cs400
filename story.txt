Losing Power
Intro: 
      Into the dark and early morning I sat working to finish the report I had started. Though I grew more tired as I worked, 
      I knew I was almost done. Suddenly and swiftly my computer and all other appliances in my house shut down. I was standing
      in pitch black darkness. All of the other houses along the road were just as dark, including the street lamps. 
      What disturbed me most: there was no clear reason why we would lose power. We hadn't seen a storm in weeks.
      
      Do I tell somoeone? Everyone in the house should be asleep. It would probabaly be best not to wake them. It could have just been the deep darkness that seemed to lay heavy in the room, but it felt as though the room was getting colder. How long would it be until some moring warmth would climb over the horizon and rid me of this dark room. It was quiet too. Still too early to hear moring birds, the only noises came from the small fan in the corner of my room. The only noises until a loud knock on my door.
