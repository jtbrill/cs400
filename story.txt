Losing Power
Intro: 
      Into the dark and early morning I sat working to finish the report I had started. Though I grew more tired as I worked, 
      I knew I was almost done. Suddenly and swiftly my computer and all other appliances in my house shut down. I was standing
      in pitch black darkness. All of the other houses along the road were just as dark, including the street lamps. 
      What disturbed me most: there was no clear reason why we would lose power. We hadn't seen a storm in weeks.
